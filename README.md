# OpenCore-Gigabyte-GA-Z170-Gaming-K3

OpenCore configuration for the Gigabyte GA-Z170 Gaming K3 motherboard.
This configuration was designed to run macOS 11 Big Sur, but may possibly
be adapted to run newer versions of macOS.

Before it can be used, you must add OpenCore.efi, OpenCanopy.efi and OpenRuntime.efi
from the latest OpenCore version.

I no longer own this motherboard, and thus, will not be updating it any further.
